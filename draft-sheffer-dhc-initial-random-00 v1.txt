          A DHCP Extension To Provide Initial Random Material
                  draft-sheffer-dhc-initial-random-00

Abstract

   Many hosts and network devices possess little or no entropy when they
   are first started.  As a result, cryptographic protocols are
   initialized into a state that can be revealed by an attacker.  This
   document defines a DHCP extension that provides a network device with
   initial randomness, which the device can then use for cryptographic
   purposes.

Internet-Draft             Initial Randomness              November 2013


1.  Introduction

   Many security algorithms and all security protocols require random
   material for secure use.  Ideally, such randomness should be provided
   by a physical source of entropy, a "True Random Number Generator"
   (TRNG).  Unfortunately, such sources of entropy are not universally
   available, and other sources, such as clock variations, observed
   packets etc., may not suffice when bootstrapping a device for the
   first time.

   Recently it was discovered [factorable.net] that a relatively high
   percentage of TLS and SSH public keys in the wild share a factor.
   The reason for that is

   This document proposes that network devices request initial random
   material from a DHCP server.  The server can provide such material
   either by extracting it and depleting the server's entropy pool, or
   through a deterministic but cryptographically strong process (a
   "Pseudo-Random Number Generator", PRNG).  The client should then mix
   the obtained material into its own PRNG.

   The proposal does not mandate any particular use by the client, but
   Section 4 describes various ways of applying it in different
   settings.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   All the DHCP related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol v4
   (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol v6
   (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] specifications.  DHCP refers to both DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6 messages and entities throughout this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The Initial Randomness Extension

2.1.  Extension Format

   The extension consists of a single Flags octet, followed by a
   variable-length Random Material field of arbitrary (random) octets.
   The field's length is at least 16 octets, and at most 64 octets.

   DHCPv4:

    Code               Random Material
   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+--
   |TBD1 | Len | Flg |  r1 |  r2 |  r3 |  r4 |  r5 | ...
   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+--

                        Figure 1: DHCPv4 Extension

   The Len field is the length of the Flags field and the random octets,
   and excludes the Code field and the Length field itself.

   Flags consists of the following bit flags:

          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          |X|X|X|X|t|p|T|P|
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

3.  Use of Random Material

   Understanding the uses of cryptographic random material within a
   typical host will help to relax OS-level dependencies and allow the
   various components to only request randomness when enough entropy is
   available.  This discussion is at a high level, and focused on Linux,
   but we assume that other operating systems employ similar mechanisms.

3.1.  Kernel Use

   The kernel uses randomness for various basic protocols.  Two
   important examples are TCP Syn cookies (where a long-lived key is
   generated early on in the system's life-cycle) and message IDs for
   numerous protocols, e.g.  DNS.  In addition, a lot of entropy is used
   for ASLR.

3.2.  User-Space Applications

   Randomness is critical to all important security protocols: TLS, SSH
   and IPsec.  SSH stands out because a long-lived server key is
   typically generated as soon as the SSH server is started for the
   first time.  This is often too early for enough entropy to have been
   collected.

4.  Alternatives and Applicability

   We describe several use cases, and for each one, whether and how this
   extension can be used.

4.1.  Alternatives to This Proposal

   In general, there are three good alternatives to the current
   solution:

   1.  Use of an on-board hardware based TRNG, such as the Intel RdRand
       instruction [xxx].
   2.  Pre-provisioning, with the manufacturer of the device creating a
       unique and secret value on each new device, and seeding the RNG
       with this value.
   3.  In virtual systems, use of randomness obtained from the host (see
       Section 4.4).

   It is noted that option #2 can be implemented by the current
   extension, when used in a secure network.

   While all alternatives are technically feasible today, there are
   still many platforms that do not use any of them.

4.2.  Desktop Computers and Other Clients

   Desktop computers and mobile devices can often sample entropy from
   their interaction with the user, e.g. from timing variations in
   keyboard input.  However in many cases such interaction takes place
   relatively late, and using this DHCP extension can provide earlier
   random material.

4.3.  Servers

   Servers typically have much less opportunity to seed their entropy
   pool from human interaction, and so are probably the best candidates
   for using this extension.  Note that although most servers do not
   request an IP address through DHCP, they can request other DHCP
   parameters, including the current extension, through the DHCPINFORM
   message.

4.4.  Virtual Hosts

   Virtual machines (VMs) are probably the most entropy-starved
   computers.  For VMs running in private networks, a DHCP server is
   typically available and the current solution is viable and
   recommended.  In public cloud environments, a DHCP server is often
   unavailable.  In such environments, the best solution is for the

Internet-Draft             Initial Randomness              November 2013


   guest to obtain randomness from the host machine, using techniques
   such as [virtio].  Note that VMs are also subject to related attacks,
   such as [vm rollback].

4.5.  Home Routers

   These devices are typically deployed as DHCP servers themselves, and
   typically start off with very little entropy.  Unfortunately the
   current extension cannot be used to initialize them.


5.  Security Considerations

   In addition to those listed here, please refer to [randomness] for
   further considerations.

5.1.  RNG Properties

   This document assumes a modern crypto-grade RNG on both client and
   server, which should have at least the following properties:

   o  The output stream cannot be distinguished from truly random
      without knowing the secret state.
   o  The RNG can be fed by external material.  Such material will
      normally increase, and will never decrease the generator's
      entropy.
   o  The generator's internal state can never be revealed to an
      attacker, even if the attacker can feed any amount of known data
      into the RNG.

5.2.  Resistance Against Network Attacks

   The current extension is not resistant to either passive or active
   attackers.  Specifically, if an attacker knows the complete state of
   the RNG, and is able to listen in on the local network, they will be
   able to compute the state of the RNG after it has been fed with the
   random material.

5.3.  Denial of Service

   An active attacker can use this extension to overload the server's
   CPU and possibly to exhaust the server's entropy pool.  To avoid such
   attacks, the server SHOULD rate-limit responses to this particular
   extension.

Internet-Draft             Initial Randomness              November 2013


5.4.  Saving RNG State

   The current extension is targeted at the initial bootstrap of a host
   or device.  Implementations MUST ensure that the generator's state is
   preserved across reboot.  The state SHOULD be stored periodically so
   that it is not lost upon a catastrophic event, such as an unplanned
   power down.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the DHCP Initial Randomness option which
   requires assignment of DHCPv4 option code TBD1 assigned from the
   "Bootp and DHCP options" registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   bootp-dhcp-parameters/bootp-dhcp-parameters.xml), as specified in
   [RFC2939].

   This document defines the DHCP Initial Randomness option which
   requires assignment of DHCPv6 option code TBD2 assigned from the
   "DHCP option Codes" registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xml).


7.  Acknowledgements

   This proposal was inspired by a discussion on the Cryptography
   mailing list, and we would like to thank John Gilmore for triggering
   the idea of "BOOTP for RNG".
