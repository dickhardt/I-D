1. You suppose to allocate 16-bytes long SPI for probe response
   from "reserved" SPI space. The packet looks like UDP-encapsulated
   IPsec packet, so it must start from ESP SPI, for which the values
   below 256 are reserved. So, why do you make your "SPI"
   16 bytes long, while 4 bytes is enough to distinguish it from
   both IKE and IPsec?

2. What's the reason to allocate new payloads for AutoVPN Nonce
   and (especially) for Contact Details? Why Notify Payload cannot be used?
   It is more cheap resource and, I think, well suited for these
   purposes.
